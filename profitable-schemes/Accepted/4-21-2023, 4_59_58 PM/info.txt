The size of 102 is chosen based on the constraints of the problem, \n    which state that the maximum size of group and profit vectors is 100, and the maximum value of n and minProfit is also 100.\n\n    By using an array of size 102 x 102 x 102, the solution provides an additional buffer to account for the indices \n    ranging from 0 to 101, which allows for convenient indexing and storage of intermediate results without causing \n    out-of-bounds access or memory overflow issues.\n\n*/\n\n/*\n    The solve() function is a recursive helper function that implements the dynamic programming approach. \n    It takes the current job index k, the number of people already assigned i, the profit already achieved j, \n    the total number of people n, the minimum profit required minProfit, and the group and profit vectors as input.\n\n*/\n\n/*\n    The base cases for the recursion are:\n\n    If k is equal to the size of profit vector, meaning all jobs have been considered, \n    then the function checks if j is greater than or equal to minProfit and i is less than \n    or equal to n. If both conditions are satisfied, it returns 1, otherwise 0.\n    If n is less than i, meaning the total number of people assigned exceeds the limit, then it returns 0.\n*/\n\n/*\n    The recursive calls in the solve() function are as follows:\n\n    notInclude: Calls solve() with the next job index k+1, i, j, n, minProfit, group, and profit, \n    without including the current job in the assignment.\n\n    include: Calls solve() with the next job index k+1, i incremented by group[k], \n    j incremented by profit[k] (but limited by minProfit), n, minProfit, group, and profit, \n    including the current job in the assignment.\n*/\n\n/*\n    The final result is stored in the dp[k][i][j] array to avoid redundant calculations, \n    and it is returned as (include % mod + notInclude % mod) % mod, where mod is a constant value of 1e9+7, \n    which is used for taking modulo to prevent integer overflow. \n*/\n\n/*\n    The profitableSchemes() function initializes the dp array with -1, and then calls the solve() function \n    with initial parameters k=0, i=0, j=0, and returns the resul\n*/\n\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    int dp[102][102][102]; // 3D array to store results of subproblems\n    int mod = 1e9 + 7; // modulo constant for preventing integer overflow\n    \n    int solve(int k, int i, int j, int n, int minProfit, vector<int>& group, vector<int>& profit) {\n\n        // Base case 1: All jobs have been considered\n        if(k == profit.size()) {\n            // Check if minimum profit is achieved and people assigned is within limit\n            if(j >= minProfit && n >= i) {\n                return 1;\n            } else {\n                return 0;\n            }\n                \n        }\n        // Base case 2: Number of people assigned exceeds the limit\n        else if(n < i) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n            \n        \n        // If result already calculated, return it\n        if(dp[k][i][j] != -1) {\n            return dp[k][i][j];\n        }\n            \n        \n        int include = 0, notInclude = 0; // Variables to store results with/without including current job\n        \n        // Recursive call without including current job\n        notInclude = solve(k + 1, i, j, n, minProfit, group, profit);\n        \n        // Recursive call including current job\n        include = solve(k + 1, i + group[k], min(j + profit[k], minProfit), n, minProfit, group, profit);\n        \n        // Store result in dp array and return\n        return dp[k][i][j] = (include % mod + notInclude % mod) % mod;\n    }\n    \n    int profitableSchemes(int n, int minProfit, vector<int>& group, vector<int>& profit) {\n        memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp)); // Initialize dp array with -1\n        return solve(0, 0, 0, n, minProfit, group, profit); // Call solve with initial parameters\n    }\n};\n\n\n\n","compare_result":"111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111","title_slug":"profitable-schemes","has_notes":false,"flag_type":1}
